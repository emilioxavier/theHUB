> I used to joke that my friend Jeff would attend every professional development course offered even if he took it last month. Today, you could say the same thing about me. Continuously learning about yourself and your field allows you to grow in new and different ways and ensures that you are always in the know. Thank you, Jeff.

We see professional development as the combination of an individual's growth and learning new aspects of our field. While we attempt to balance these two areas, we know that an individual's professional development is unique and based on their immediate and long term goals. 

The following are a collection of articles and books that we have read and helped inform our view of our work. They are organized based on the areas of **Professional Development**, **About Data & Modelling**, and **Writing Code**.
