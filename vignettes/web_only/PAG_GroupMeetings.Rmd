While we focus on answering questions related to enrollment, we know an implied mission is assisting in the development of those who want to do similar work. To this end, we hold group meetings where we discuss

 - Relevant research articles
 - Application of function-specific applications
 - Examples of new (to us) coding methods
 - Our research success and setbacks

We invite and welcome those outside of our group to join our meetings. Please contact [Emilio](mailto:emilio@msu.edu?subject=I%20want%20to%20attend%20PAG%20group%20meetings!) for meeting information.


## Group Meeting Schedule

Group Meeting are every couple of weeks where the current and past members come together to share updates about current and past work. Our Group Meeting schedule and agenda is loose. Each meeting starts with a quick "stand-up" where everyone briefly talks about...

  - what they are working on
  - one thing causing grief
  - one victory

_**The meetings are informal discussions on current projects and help overcoming coding and research obstacles.**_ 
  
Everyone is welcome to attend! Please contact [Emilio](mailto:emilio@msu.edu?subject=I%20want%20to%20attend%20PAG%20group%20meetings!) for day, time and location (usually a local coffee shop). Sometimes we meet on Zoom; email Emilio for the link.

<!-- We meet on campus in the [College of Agriculture and Natural Resources](http://www.canr.msu.edu/) building. -->

  <!-- - The **Tuesday "General" meetings** are a catch-all for coding demonstrations, help solving research and coding conundrums, guest speakers, and administrative and management discussions.  -->
  <!-- - The **Thursday meetings** are an opportunity for each group member (see schedule below) to present an aspect of their project. -->
  <!-- - We meet in person for [book club](#BookClub) discussion and these meetings take the place of a predetermined Thursday meeting. Check the meeting schedule below for when and where book club meets. -->
  
  <!-- The fourth Thursday of each month allows the group to meet in-person for beverages and snacks if they can easily make it to -- or near -- campus. We also have the option to cancel the fourth Thursday meeting and make this decision during the fourth Tuesday meeting. -->


## Book Club {#BookClub}

Book club is structured [professional development](PAG_ProfessionalDevelopment.html). The goal is to gain knowledge and insight to current projects through the perspective of someone else.

_**Spring/2023**_: We read and discussed _Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy_ by Cathy Oâ€™Neil ([Bookshop](https://bookshop.org/p/books/weapons-of-math-destruction-how-big-data-increases-inequality-and-threatens-democracy-cathy-o-neil/11438502?ean=9780553418835) |  [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Weapons-Math-Destruction-Increases-Inequality/dp/0553418831/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2747LPMETBAPD) | [Apple Books](https://books.apple.com/us/book/weapons-of-math-destruction-how-big-data-increases/id1605146240)) to better understand how the data, analysis, and models we create impacts others.
