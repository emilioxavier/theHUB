Welcome to the official webpages of the _**unofficial**_ Predictive Analytics Group (PAG)! We work within the [Associate Provost Office of Enrollment and Academic Strategic Planning](https://esp.msu.edu) at [Michigan State University](https://www.msu.edu). 

Our work is at the intersection of potential and current students' data to ask and answer questions about potential students' behaviors and outcomes. Using our combined expertise in economics, analytics, and predictive modelling, we provide a unique perspective on student-centric quandaries. Currently, we are studying economic mobility and gaining a deeper understanding of applicants.

We believe in creating and fostering a supportive and inclusive environment for our members to thrive and advance their career. To support our efforts, we developed and adopted an evolving collection of [Guidelines & Policies](PAG_GuidelinesAndPolicies.html) and [prompts about how each of us likes to be mentored](PAG_HowILikeToBeMentored.html).

We have two [group meetings](PAG_GroupMeetings.html) a week. The Tuesday meetings are for general updates and questions and Thursday meetings are a chance for each member to present a deep view of their work. Meetings start at 3p and end between 4p and 4:30p. Everyone is welcome to attend! Please contact [Emilio](mailto:emilio@msu.edu?subject=I%20want%20to%20attend%20PAG%20group%20meetings!) for the Zoom link.
