Often we struggle with consistently pulling the same data from the same sources due to differences in interpretation of terms. These inconsistencies are frustrating. We believe providing the code used to construct datasets is the easiest way to ensure reproducibility. Adequately documenting the code and noting changes ensures that everyone understands what the script does, how it is done, and provides a historical retrospective of the changes. Script libraries streamline the process of data retrieval by removing a hurdle to accessing data and reducing the time to acquire the data. Anytime spent on the cataloging data pull scripts is gained back when others use them.

We welcome others to provide their scripts for others to use. Please contact Emilio ([MSU email](mailto:emilio@msu.edu?subject=EDW%20scripts) | [Gmail](mailto:emilio.esposito@gmail.com?subject=EDW%20scripts)) to arrange the inclusion of your scripts. Alternatively, perform a pull request.
