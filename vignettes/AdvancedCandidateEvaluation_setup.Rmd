## Embedded Data

The embedded data contains the modifiable variables within the survey. These variables need to be set for each search. The _**PositionTitle**_ and _**Unit**_ are the title and unit, respectively, used in the original posting. 

| Variable Name | Description |
|:-------------:|:-----------------------------|
| PositionTitle | The title of the position |
| CommitteeChair | The name of the Search Committee Chair |
| Unit | The name of the unit searching for the position |
| CloseDate | Date the evaluation (aka survey) closes |
| CloseTime | Time the evaluation (aka survey) closes |
| DeleteDate | Date the Qualtrics survey and data will be deleted |
| Candidate_#: | The name of the candidate. Replace the **#** symbol with a cardinal number. There can be as many candidates as needed. See example below. |

_NB_: Do not use special characters like emojis, periods (.), dollar signs ($), and hashtags (#) when naming your embedded data variables. See [Qualtric's webpage on Best Practices and Troubleshooting Embedded Data](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/survey-flow/standard-elements/embedded-data/#BestPractices) for more information about embedded data.
