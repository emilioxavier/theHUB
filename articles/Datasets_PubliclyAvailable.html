<p>NCES relies on information about school location to help construct
school-based surveys, support program administration, identify
associations with other types of geographic entities, and to help
investigate the social and spatial context of education. EDGE creates
and assigns address geocodes (estimated latitude/latitude values) and
other geographic indicators to public schools, public local education
agencies, private schools, and postsecondary schools. The geographic
data are provided as shapefiles, and basic attribute data are available
as Excel and SAS tables. These data are also directly accessible as GIS

<p>In a collaboration with Raj Chetty and Nathan Hendren from Harvard
University and John Friedman from Brown University, we constructed the
Opportunity Atlas, a comprehensive Census tract-level dataset of
children’s outcomes in adulthood using data covering nearly the entire
U.S. population. For each tract, we estimate children’s outcomes in
adulthood such as earnings distributions and incarceration rates by
parental income, race, and gender. These estimates allow us to trace the
roots of outcomes such as poverty and incarceration to the neighborhoods
in which children grew up.</p>
<p>To build the Atlas, we use de-identified data from the 2000 and 2010
decennial Censuses linked to data from Federal income tax returns and
the 2005-2015 American Community Surveys (ACS) to obtain information on
income, parental characteristics, children’s neighborhoods, and other
variables. We focus on children born between 1978-1983, including those
born in the U.S. and authorized childhood immigrants. Our data include
the characteristics of 20 million children, approximately 94% of all
children born during the time period.</p>

City, Suburban, Town, and Rural.</li>
<li>
<strong>Senior class size</strong>: Three-year average of the senior

<li>
<strong>Average SAT scores at colleges attended</strong>: Average of
first-year student SAT scores at four-year colleges attended by the
three most recent cohorts of college-bound seniors from the applicant’s
high school who took any College Board assessments aggregate College
Board and National Student Clearinghouse data). Average SAT scores are
calculated using data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data

<p>Admissions officers asked us to capture six key indicators about
applicants’ communities and high schools. Research has shown these six
indicators are related to students’ educational opportunities and
outcomes.</p>
<p>These indicators are provided at the neighborhood level, which is
defined by a student’s census tract, and at the high school level, which
is defined by the census tracts of college-bound seniors at a high
school.</p>
<p>Applicants from the same census tract share the same neighborhood
data and indicators; applicants from the same high school share the same
high school data and indicators. The indicators are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>College attendance</strong>: The predicted probability that
a student from the neighborhood/high school enrolls in a 4-year college
(aggregate College Board and National Student Clearinghouse data)</li>
<li>
<strong>Household structure</strong>: Neighborhood/high school
information about the number of married or coupled families,
single-parent families, and children living under the poverty line
(American Community Survey)</li>
<li>
<strong>Median family income</strong>: Median family income among
those in the neighborhood/high school (American Community Survey)</li>
<li>
<strong>Housing stability</strong>: Neighborhood/high school
information about vacancy rates, rental vs. home ownership, and
mobility/housing turnover (American Community Survey)</li>
<li>
<strong>Education levels</strong>: Information about the typical
educational attainment in the neighborhood/high school (American
Community Survey)</li>
<li>
<strong>Crime</strong>: The predicted probability of being a victim
of a crime in the neighborhood or neighborhoods represented by the
students attending the high school. Data provided by Location, Inc. For
more information, please visit <a href="www.LocationInc.com/data">www.LocationInc.com/data</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These 6 indicators are averaged and presented on a 1–100 scale to
provide a Neighborhood Average and High School Average. A higher value
on the 1–100 scale indicates a higher level of challenge related to
educational opportunities and outcomes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Metadata Updated: December 3, 2021</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This dataset contains model-based census tract level estimates for
the PLACES 2021 release in GIS-friendly format. PLACES is the expansion
of the original 500 Cities project and covers the entire United
States—50 states and the District of Columbia (DC)—at county, place,
census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) levels. It represents
a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this
large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were
provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch.
PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in
conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these
model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
(BRFSS) 2019 or 2018 data, Census Bureau 2010 population estimates, and
American Community Survey (ACS) 2015–2019 or 2014–2018 estimates. The
2021 release uses 2019 BRFSS data for 22 measures and 2018 BRFSS data
for 7 measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, cervical
cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services
among older adults, and sleeping less than 7 hours a night). Seven
measures are based on the 2018 BRFSS data because the relevant questions
are only asked every other year in the BRFSS. These data can be joined
with the census tract 2015 boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps
for 29 measures at the census tract level. An ArcGIS Online feature
service is also available for users to make maps online or to add data
to desktop GIS software. <a href="https://cdcarcgis.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=3b7221d4e47740cab9235b839fa55cd7" class="external-link">https://cdcarcgis.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=3b7221d4e47740cab9235b839fa55cd7</a></p>

</h4>
<p>Every community must prepare for and respond to hazardous events,
whether a natural disaster like a tornado or a disease outbreak, or an
anthropogenic event such as a harmful chemical spill. The degree to
which a community exhibits certain social conditions, including high
poverty, low percentage of vehicle access, or crowded households, may
affect that community’s ability to prevent human suffering and financial
loss in the event of disaster. These factors describe a community’s
social vulnerability.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-cdc-social-vulnerability-index">What is CDC Social Vulnerability Index?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-is-cdc-social-vulnerability-index"></a>
</h4>
<p>ATSDR’s Geospatial Research, Analysis &amp; Services Program (GRASP)
created Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Social Vulnerability
Index (CDC SVI or simply SVI, hereafter) to help public health officials
and emergency response planners identify and map the communities that
will most likely need support before, during, and after a hazardous
event.</p>
<p>SVI indicates the relative vulnerability of every U.S. Census tract.
Census tracts are subdivisions of counties for which the Census collects
statistical data. SVI ranks the tracts on 15 social factors, including
unemployment, minority status, and disability, and further groups them
into four related themes. Thus, each tract receives a ranking for each
Census variable and for each of the four themes, as well as an overall
ranking.</p>
<p>In addition to tract-level rankings, SVI 2010, 2014, 2016, and 2018
also have corresponding rankings at the county level. Notes below that
describe “tract” methods also refer to county methods.</p>
