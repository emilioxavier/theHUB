<p>We want you to feel valued and respected while you work in the
Predictive Analytics Group; sometimes called PAG. This document (the
Predictive Analytics Group Guidelines &amp; Polices) outlines and
describes the reason we have these guidelines. These guidelines are
designed to protect the all members of our group, but most importantly,
the most vulnerable, commonly, junior members. We share our guidelines
with all groups we work with to ensure they understand our
expectations.</p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="group-structure">Group Structure<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#group-structure"></a>
</h2>
<p>We strive for an egalitarian and flat management structure. We only
use first or preferred names or nickname approved by you. No titles. No
last names. Decisions are made after discussions and everyone, that
wants to, provides input, and based on what is best for the group. Our
structure is different from what you will likely experience elsewhere,
but we believe your experiences, skills, and knowledge are what matter.
The goal with all of our guidelines is to remove the power dynamic and
give junior members an equal voice and status.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="culture-of-gratitude">Culture of Gratitude<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#culture-of-gratitude"></a>
</h2>
<p>We work with a lot of people outside of <a href="https://esp.msu.edu" class="external-link">Enrollment Management</a> and often ask them
for help that adds to their daily workload. The least we can do is say
“thank you” for their time. Please send a “thank you” email after your
meeting or a request has been fulfilled and copy their supervisor. The
goal is to model the behaviour we want to see in others.</p>
<p><em>NB: I know this section appears odd. When I joined <a href="https://msu.edu" class="external-link">Michigan State University (MSU)</a> I was told to
never expect a “thank you” from anyone. This was extremely troubling to
me (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilioxavieresposito" class="external-link">Emilio</a>) and
something I wanted to change. The <a href="https://twitter.com/MSUHub" class="external-link">Hub for Innovation in Teaching and
Technology</a>, my original group at MSU, worked tirelessly to ensure
everyone on campus knew they were appreciated. While I know I cannot
change an institution the size of MSU, I knew I could attempt to change
the culture around me.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="projects">Projects<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#projects"></a>
</h2>
<p>Within each project, members will have defined roles. This allows
each person to focus on a specific aspect of the project and will be
assigned to ensure members are learning and growing different skills.
Every project has three distinct areas: design and development,
documentation, and implementation. The person leading the design and
development leads the project, yet there is an additional member
responsible for documentation and implementation. All members are
responsible for a project’s success and completion. We expect project
members to work together and hold each other accountable. We also expect
members to engage with others – either PAG member or others at the
university – when they have a question or need help.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="presenting-your-work">Presenting Your Work<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#presenting-your-work"></a>
</h2>
<p>Leading a project also means you are the face of the project. You are
the one presenting to leadership and the project’s stakeholders.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="sharing-our-work">Sharing Our Work<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sharing-our-work"></a>
</h2>
<p>We do excellent and impactful work that others will see and want to
adopt. Our field relies on the reproducibility of our work and
documentation to explain what was done and why. While a project might
start as a one-off, it will likely turn into a routine analysis or
prediction. Creating easy to understand scripts and detailed
documentation aids the transition from the single occurrence to
repeatable product. We will work in groups to ensure all projects are
documented and the scripts work for multiple group members.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="collaboration-via-code-data-documentation">Collaboration via Code, Data, &amp; Documentation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#collaboration-via-code-data-documentation"></a>
</h2>
<p>Your closest collaborator is you in six-months. Ways to help “future
you” are easy to understand file and folder names, adding documentation
and functions to <a href="https://theHopefulBox.com" class="external-link">the Hopeful Utility
Box</a>, heavily commented code, and detailed descriptions of actions
and outcomes within scripts.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="comments-and-critiques">Comments and Critiques<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#comments-and-critiques"></a>
</h2>
<p>We constantly evaluate our work and the work of others. It is
imperative that all comments are constructive, supportive, and help the
author(s) improve their work. Remember to critique the ideas and work,
not the individual.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="truth-to-power">Truth to Power<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#truth-to-power"></a>
</h2>
<p>You are encouraged and expected to speak “truth to power” when
discussing and debating policies, your work, and how your work
influences and shapes policies. It is unacceptable for someone to take
and misrepresent your work. Please let someone in the group know if you
believe this is happening.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="asking-questions-and-for-help">Asking Questions and for Help<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#asking-questions-and-for-help"></a>
</h2>
<p>There is no shame in saying, “I don’t know.” Feel free to say these
three words at any time. This phrase starts the learning process and
developing a deeper understanding. We also ask questions (a lot of
questions) because we want to learn more and we want you to learn more.
The questions are not coming from a place of malice.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="work-environment">Work Environment<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#work-environment"></a>
</h2>
<p>The work performed by the Predictive Analytics Group (PAG) lends
itself to being asynchronous and remote. We rely heavily on shared
folders within MSU One Drive, text-based communication (via email or
Microsoft Teams), two meetings a week, and co-work sessions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="work-schedule">Work Schedule<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#work-schedule"></a>
</h2>
<p>Being an asynchronous and remote group means we understand and
embrace those with unique schedules. We will work with everyone’s needs
and requirements. We also fully understand that life is an ever-changing
series of events. Do you work best late at night? Awesome. Get your best
work done between 5 and 8 in the morning? Great. All we ask is you take
care of yourself, are productive, and be present at meetings.</p>
<p><em><strong>While we will work diligently to ensure projects are
completed in a timely fashion, there are the rare occasions when we are
required to work outside our expected work hours. We will try to
indicate when this is likely to happen as early as
possible.</strong></em></p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="career-advancement">Career Advancement<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#career-advancement"></a>
</h2>
<p>We want everyone that joins the PAG to have as many opportunities
available to them as they want. There will be opportunities to present
your work at meetings with leadership and campus working groups and at
campus, regional, and national meetings.</p>
<p>We hope that everyone that joins the group stays forever. We also
know this is impossible. At an institution like MSU – and in a field
such as predictive analytics – there are many excellent opportunities
outside of our group. It will be sad to see someone leave for a new and
better experience for them, but we will fully support them. We see it as
a compliment when a PAG member leaves for a new opportunity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="continued-education">Continued Education<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#continued-education"></a>
</h2>
<p>Constantly learning is a hallmark of our field. The discovery of new
methods and the application of established methods from other fields is
common. We support everyone’s desire to attend seminars across campus,
take classes, and attend workshops. All we ask is you share what you
learn with the group.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="times-when-we-communicate">Times When We Communicate<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#times-when-we-communicate"></a>
</h2>
<p>We understand that everyone is productive at different hours of the
day. Please understand that an immediate response to your query might
not be possible. Letting us know your preferred working times (see Work
Schedule above) helps us understand when you are communicating.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="preferred-communication-methodmode">Preferred Communication Method/Mode<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#preferred-communication-methodmode"></a>
</h2>
<p>To support our asynchronous and remote work style, it is important to
have clear lines of communication. Email is the official communications
method for project related information and meetings invitations.
Typically, other communication takes place via the Teams messaging
system. We understand a messaging application such as Teams might not be
your ideal way of communicating with group members. We completely
understand. Please let us know if you don’t like using messaging systems
and we will communicate via another methods. Please understand that due
to the nature of our work we need to use the communication tools
provided by MSU. This means MSU email accounts and Teams.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="communication-methodsmodes">Communication Methods/Modes<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#communication-methodsmodes"></a>
</h2>
<p>We are constrained by the tools provided by MSU. This means Microsoft
email and Teams. Project reports and formal communications with
stakeholders should be performed via emails as it typically provides an
easy-to-follow trail. Informal discussions with groups members and
in-meeting discussions (during a video discussion) should use Teams.
When it comes to intra-group discussions, the choice is between group
members. Please let us know your preferred communication method.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="sometimes-email-is-required-and-mandatory">Sometimes Email is Required (and Mandatory)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sometimes-email-is-required-and-mandatory"></a>
</h2>
<p>Due to the various communication methods/modes, we often receive
requests from group members and other units across campus in various
modes. It is not uncommon to receive a request via a messaging system
(e.g., Teams, Slack, SMS, Messages to name a few). Because messaging
systems are in-the-moment and often contain numerous topics, searching
for specific topics can be difficult. When you receive a request for a
number, dataset, where to find information, via a messaging system:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Copy the question/request into an email</li>
<li>Write your response</li>
<li>Send the email</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="time-off">Time Off<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#time-off"></a>
</h2>
<p>We acknowledge taking time off from work is hard and sometimes feels
impossible. We encourage and support taking time away from work.
Everyone needs a break. Take them. Everyone will work with you to ensure
you get the time you need away from work. We strongly encourage everyone
to step away from work on the weekends and during the holidays. We do
not expect you to check or respond to any communications on the weekends
or holidays.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="meetings">Meetings<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#meetings"></a>
</h2>
<p>Due to the distributed nature of our work, meetings to discuss
projects along with their success and hurdles are necessary. Currently,
we meet as a <a href="PAG_GroupMeetings.Rmd">group twice a week on
Tuesday and Thursday at 3p for 60 minutes</a>. Sometimes these meetings
run long, up to 90 minutes due to technical discussions. The main reason
for the longer meetings is our struggle to resolve data access issues,
the meetings will focus more on the research projects. A goal of future
meetings is to have a formal agenda and schedule where group members
present their research projects, interesting methods, and evaluations of
articles.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="meeting-scheduling-rules">Meeting Scheduling Rules<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#meeting-scheduling-rules"></a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Meetings need to be scheduled with a minimum of 24-hours advanced
notice.</li>
<li>Meetings are only scheduled for Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday
unless those attending the meeting agree to holding the meeting on
Monday or Friday.</li>
<li>Meeting can start at 10a and must finish by 4:30p.</li>
<li>No meetings over lunch.</li>
<li>Meetings run times are 75% of the scheduled duration. Thus, a
meeting scheduled for 60 minutes will last 45 minutes. The remaining
time allows participants to regroup and prepare (if another meeting
follows) for their next meeting.</li>
<li>Meeting times will respect, to the best of our ability, the time
zones of all group members. This might mean that meeting fall outside
the time span noted above. We will determine a solution when
needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>We request that all participants of meetings be fully present. We
also understand this is difficult given everyone’s responsibilities.
During online meetings we request you be on camera though we understand
if you need to step away from time to time.</p>
