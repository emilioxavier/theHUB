## Introduction
The collecting and formatting of information to send to Clearinghouse is often seen as a daunting task with little room for error. This Rmarkdown document (aka `R` notebook or script) is designed to help streamline the process through a standardized workflow.

The format of this notebook is different than the [How To](), but is designed to provide the needed information. This `R` notebook requires the [DBI](), [rJava](), [RJDBC](), [keyring](), and [tidyverse]() packages and they are load at the start of the notebook. 


### Define User-Specified Variables
The user-defined variables provide easy modification of the script for future Clearinghouse data requests. The available application types are undergraduate (`UGRD`), graduate (`GRAD`), human medicine (`HMED`), osteopathic medicine (`OMED`), veternary medicine (`VMED`), agriculture technology (`AGTC`), graduate certificate (`GCRT`), law school (`LAW`), MSU law school (`LAWM`),  (`NON`), and (`NONL`). Notice the format for the `search.start` and `search.stop` dates. They are in the day-month-year (DDMMYYYY; 01-aug-2021) format to accommodate SQL queries. The dates will be transformed by the script for different portions of the data request. The MSUEDW user name, institution name and code, branch code, and search type are also set.

```{r UserVariables, echo=TRUE}
application.type <- "UGRD"
search.start <- "01-aug-2021"
search.stop <- "01-aug-2022"
EDW.username <- "emilio"

institution.name <- "Michigan State University"
institution.code <- "002290"
branch.code <- "00"
search.type <- "SE"
```

```{r ReformatDates, include=FALSE}
search.start.DT <- lubridate::dmy(x=search.start)
search.start.yyyymmdd <- paste0(lubridate::year(search.start.DT),
                                formatC(lubridate::month(search.start.DT), flag="0", width=2),
                                formatC(lubridate::day(search.start.DT), flag="0", width=2))

today.date <- lubridate::today()
file.date <- paste0(lubridate::year(today.date), 
                    formatC(lubridate::month(today.date), flag="0", width=2), 
                    formatC(lubridate::day(today.date), flag="0", width=2))

filename.date <- paste0(as.vector(lubridate::month(today.date, label=TRUE, abbr=TRUE)),
                        formatC(lubridate::day(today.date), flag="0", width=2), 
                        lubridate::year(today.date))
```

```{r CreateFileNames}
xlsx.filename <- paste0("Clearinghouse_data_request_", filename.date, ".xlsx")
csv.filename <- paste0("Clearinghouse_data_request_", filename.date, ".csv")
RData.filename <- paste0("Clearinghouse_data_request_", filename.date, ".RData")
```

### Header

## Obtaining Data from MSUEDW
The following `R` commands provide the steps to assist the construction of the Clearinghouse data request. Before using the information below, please ensure the required R-SQL setup was completed. The instructions on how to setup an `R` session to interact with the MSUEDW is available in the [EDW: R-SQL Setup](https://thehopefulbox.com/articles/EDW_R-SQLsetup.html) article.





### Setup the MSUEDW Connection
These commands will initiate a connection with the MSUEDW. Please ensure the `classPath` matches your installation. The `USERNAME` in `"/Users/USERNAME/software/ojdbc11-full/ojdbc11.jar"` is a placeholder. Please ensure the `classPath` is correct. For more information, view the [EDW: R-SQL Setup](https://thehopefulbox.com/articles/EDW_R-SQLsetup.html) article. 

```{r SetupMSUEDWconnection}
jdbcDriver <- RJDBC::JDBC(driverClass="oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver", 
                          classPath="/Users/USERNAME/software/ojdbc11-full/ojdbc11.jar")
                          
MSUEDW.jdbc <- DBI::dbConnect(jdbcDriver, 
                              "jdbc:oracle:thin:@//ebsprd390d.ais.msu.edu:1521/MSUEDW.EBSP.MSU.EDU",
                              EDW.username, 
                              keyring::key_get("MSUEDW", EDW.username))
```


### Reformat the Dates
The dates of interest are constructed in the format needed by Clearinghouse, and the date for the resulting Excel workbook and CSV file are constructed. 


### Collect the Data
Clearinghouse uses the applicant's full name and date of birth to identify them within their comprehensive database. Three Tables/Views within the MSUEDW contain the needed data to construct the Clearinghouse data request. The `siscs.p_adm_appl_data_v` view contains application data and contains several date columns related to the submission of an application. The date columns are:

  - ADM_CREATION_DT: application creation date
  - ADM_APPL_DT: application submission date
  - APPL_FEE_DT: application fee paid
  - ADM_APPL_CMPLT_DT: application completion date
  - ADM_UPDATED_DT: application last updated date
  
The `siscs.p_names_v` view contains the applicant's name, and four name components are required. The column titles follow and are self-explanatory.

  - FIRST_NAME
  - MIDDLE_NAME
  - LAST_NAME
  - NAME_SUFFIX
  
The applicant's date of birth (column title BIRTHDATE) is obtained from `siscs.p_person_v`.


### Construct the SQL Queries
The three SQL queries are constructed to include the noted dates of interest. The application view (`p_adm_appl_data_v`) query fetches applicants within the restricted time frame of the applications. This example finds those that applied to MSU between 01/Aug/2021 and 01/Aug/2022 and equates to students starting in the fall/2022 semester. The full name and date of birth queries include all individuals (applicants and students) with the last updated dates since the first day of the application query. The provided queries are general, and you are encouraged to change them to fit your needs.

```{r ConstructQueries}
apply.query <- paste("select *
 from siscs.p_adm_appl_data_v
 where ACAD_CAREER='", application.type,
                     "' and ADM_CREATION_DT between '",
                     search.start, "' and '", search.stop, "'", sep="")

name.query <- paste("select *
 from siscs.p_names_v
 where LASTUPDDTTM >= '", search.start, "'", sep="")
 
DoB.query <- paste("select *
 from siscs.p_person_v
 where LAST_CHILD_UPDDTM >= '", search.start, "'", sep="")
```

There are `r nrow(apply.query)` `r application.type` applications, `r nrow(name.query)` names, and `r nrow(DoB.query)` date-of-birth entries in the three sets of data.

### Fetch the Data
The following commands send the query to the MSUEDW and fetch the data. The fetched data is pared down to only include the columns of interest and the most current entry retained for the full name.

```{r FetchData}
## pull application data ----
apply.results <- dbSendQuery(MSUEDW.jdbc, apply.query)
apply.DATA <- dbFetch(apply.results) |>
  as_tibble() |>
  select(EMPLID, ends_with("_DT"))

## pull name data ----
name.results <- dbSendQuery(MSUEDW.jdbc, name.query)
name.DATA <- dbFetch(name.results) |>
  as_tibble() |>
  select(EMPLID, NAME, FIRST_NAME, MIDDLE_NAME, LAST_NAME, NAME_SUFFIX, LASTUPDDTTM)

## pull date-of-birth data ----
DoB.results <- dbSendQuery(MSUEDW.jdbc, DoB.query)
DoB.DATA <- dbFetch(DoB.results) |>
  as_tibble() |>
  select(EMPLID, BIRTHDATE, LAST_CHILD_UPDDTM)

## disconnect from the MSUEDW ----
DBI::dbDisconnect(MSUEDW.jdbc)
```

### Merge the Data
The three data sets are merged using the student ID (`EMPLID`), where only those present in the application data are retained.

```{r MergeData}
combined.DATA <- left_join(x=apply.DATA, y=name.DATA,
          by="EMPLID") |>
  left_join(y=DoB.DATA,
            by="EMPLID")

```

### Create First Row
The first row is constructed based on the user-provided information above.

```{r CreateFirstRow}
first.row <- tibble_row(D1.col="HI",
                        blank.1=institution.code,
                        first.name=branch.code,
                        middle.initial=institution.name,
                        last.name=file.date,
                        suffix=search.type,
                        DoB="I",
                        search.date="",
                        blank.2="",
                        institution.code="",
                        branch.code="",
                        ID.number="")
```


### Build and Format the Data
The data from the merge data is reformatted, and the data to be sent to Clearinghouse is constructed.

```{r BuildClearinghouseData}
Clearinghouse.DATA <- tibble(D1.col="D1",
                             blank.1="",
                             first.name=combined.DATA$FIRST_NAME,
                             middle.initial=substr(combined.DATA$MIDDLE_NAME, start=1, stop=1),
                             last.name=combined.DATA$LAST_NAME,
                             suffix=combined.DATA$NAME_SUFFIX,
                             DoB=paste0(lubridate::year(combined.DATA$BIRTHDATE),
                                        formatC(lubridate::month(combined.DATA$BIRTHDATE), flag="0", width=2),
                                        formatC(lubridate::day(combined.DATA$BIRTHDATE), flag="0", width=2)),
                             search.date=search.start.yyyymmdd,
                             blank.2="",
                             institution.code=institution.code,
                             branch.code=branch.code,
                             ID.number=combined.DATA$EMPLID
                             ) |>
  distinct(.keep_all=TRUE)
                             
export.DATA <- bind_rows(first.row,
                         Clearinghouse.DATA)
```


### Create File Names
The file names are constructed to make exporting the data easier.


### Export the Data
The Clearinghouse data is exported as an Excel workbook and a CSV file.

```{r WriteOutData}
WriteXLS::WriteXLS(x=export.DATA,
                   ExcelFileName=xlsx.filename,
                   SheetNames="RequestDATA",
                   colnames=FALSE)

write.csv(x=export.DATA,
         file=csv.filename,
         row.names=FALSE,
         col.names=FALSE)

save(list=c("apply.DATA", "name.DATA", "DoB.DATA", "combined.DATA", "export.DATA"),
     file=RData.filename)
```
