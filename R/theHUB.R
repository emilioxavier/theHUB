#' Collection of Learning Analytics tools to evaluate surveys, student outcomes, and student success.
#'
#' @description
#'  The Hub Utility Box (theHUB; a recursive backronym) is a collection of
#'  analysis tools composed of
#'  functions, scripts, electronic notebooks, and worked examples. Sharing these
#'  tools with the MSU community improves the analyses of student outcomes,
#'  student success, and survey responses. A standard set of processes and
#'  methods along with a defined lexicon enables reproducibility, reduces the
#'  time needed to complete analysis-based projects, and allows the quick
#'  addition of new methods while encouraging data exploration. Our desire is
#'  for theHUB’s functionality to grow over time, and others at MSU will
#'  contribute new features and methods for the community. Developed and
#'  implemented in R -- an open-source application with a robust community
#'  (on campus and around the world) -- theHUB removes the need for a software
#'  license while providing access to a myriad of statistical analysis and
#'  graphing options. The documentation allows anyone to use and understand the
#'  tools. theHUB will contain the Hub's LA v2.0 projects; currently the survey analysis
#'  package, _Survey Connections_.
#'
#'  _Survey Connections_: Traditionally, survey analysis returns a collection of
#'  response counts and comment summaries without considering important and
#'  insightful relationships between questions and responses. The Survey
#'  Connections package provides workflows for cleaning survey data and
#'  performing Likert and Likert-like, multi-response, and comment analyses. The
#'  package’s goal is to easily allow the discovery of relationships between
#'  responses and the creation of cohorts for further exploration and analysis.
#'  _Analyze survey responses to gain a better understanding of the
#'  relationships between responses and respondents_.
